# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:
#### Inspecting the following: 
1. Outcomes based on our launch date.
2. Outcomes based on our funding goal.

### Our purpose for the analysis is to show Louise, how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### When inspecting the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, we can see that early in the year months are more than likely foing to be more successful than later in the year.

### Challenges or Difficulties encountered
- When I was working with the COUNTIFS formula in Excel, I did have trouble with it at first. I was not getting the right amounts, they were too high in value.  However I resolved the issue because I was not putting in the last critia range which was for subcategory plays. 

## Results

- We can conclude that in the months of May and June, Theater is the most successful. However in the months of November and December, we are the least successful in the Theater category. 

- For the plays subcategory, when we compare the ranges that are given, we can conclude that we were more successful with the range of less than $1,000.  

- Something that I noticed when looking at the data is that some of it is misleading. For instance, for the Outcomes Based on Goals chart for the ranges 45000 to 49999 it shows that 100% was failed. However if you were not looking at the data table you wouldnt see that there was on 1 play that took place for that range. 

- On the Outcomes Based on Goals worksheet, I would consider using a stacked column chart to better showecase how the failed and successful amounts added up. It is a good way to compare parts of a whole and how segments of a whole change over time.
